### My project explenation:
for my project I chose to make a web page that my grandfather could have used to upload all of the pictures and videos he took as he was exploring. Along with that I made the blog page have a weekly post to document his thoughts and opinions on the places he went. This website could be shared with his followers looking for new and old content and could interact with him with the contact form.
